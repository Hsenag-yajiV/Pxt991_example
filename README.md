# Uni thesis reconstruction

This repository showcases analytical methodologies and Python implementations developed during my MSc Astrophysics research at Cardiff University.

## Projects Overview
- **Spectroscopy Analysis**: Pipeline for analysing supernova spectra from multi-telescope surveys
- **Statistical Modelling**: Bayesian inference applications in gravitational wave analysis
- **Data Visualisation**: Advanced plotting and data presentation techniques

## Technical Stack
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Astropy, SciPy, Jupyter

*Note: These notebooks represent reconstructed methodologies from research conducted on university computing infrastructure. Original datasets have been replaced with sample/synthetic data for demonstration purposes.*
