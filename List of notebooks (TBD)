Supernovae analysis sample - spectral analysis, lots of plots, some missing data
GW wave analysis example using MCMC
gw_analysis.ipynb - Bayesian inference, mostly complete example
galaxy_evolution.ipynb - numerical modeling, fragmented

Some of these notebooks are LLM-assisted recreations from fragmented local code copies. The complete codebases are saved in the university database and are no longer accessible post-graduation.
